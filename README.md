# Project
SIG Blockchain Fall 2018 Project

Requirements: Python 3.x

We will be working on our python blockchain project here. First we will build up the base model for the blockchain, then expand on it.
The three sections we will first learn about are data structures, peer-to-peer networks, and cryptography.
Three areas of focus when building are: User Interface, Scale, and Network.

"A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that worked. A complex system designed from scratch never works and cannot be patched up to make it work. You have to start over with a working simple system." â€“ John Gall
