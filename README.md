# Project
SIG Blockchain Fall 2018 Project

Requirements: Python 3.x

We will be working on our python blockchain project here. First we will build up the base model for the blockchain, then expand on it.
The three sections we will first learn about are data structures, peer-to-peer networks, and cryptography.
Three areas of focus when building are: User Interface, Scale, and Network.
